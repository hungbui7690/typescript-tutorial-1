  Challenge - Equality Narrowing
  - Method 1 -> equality narrowing is a form of type narrowing that occurs when you use equality checks like === or !== in your code

  Challenge - Check for Property
  - Method 2 -> The <in> operator in TypeScript is used to narrow down the type of a variable when used in a conditional statement.
    + It checks if a property or method exists on an object. 
    + If it exists, TypeScript will narrow the type to the one that has this property.

/*
  - Define a function named makeSound that takes one parameter animal of type Animal.
  - Inside the function, use an if statement to check if animal.type is 'dog'.
  - If animal.type is 'dog', TypeScript knows that animal is a Dog in this block. 
    -> In this case, call the bark method of animal.
  - If animal.type is not 'dog', TypeScript knows that animal is a Cat in the else block. 
    -> In this case, call the meow method of animal.
  - Now you can call the makeSound function with an Animal as the argument. 
    -> The function will call the appropriate method (bark or meow) depending on the type of the animal.
