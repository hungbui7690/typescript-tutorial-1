/*
  Challenge - Discriminated Unions and exhaustive check using the never type
  - A discriminated union in TypeScript is a type that can be one of several different types, each identified by a unique literal property (the discriminator), allowing for type-safe handling of each possible variant.


*/

/*
  - Write a reducer function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state. The reducer function should use a switch statement or if-else chain on the type property of the action to handle each action type differently.
  - In the default case of the switch statement or the final else clause, perform an exhaustive check by assigning the action to a variable of type never. If there are any action types that haven't been handled, TypeScript will give a compile error.
  - Implement the logic for each action type in the reducer function. This typically involves returning a new state based on the current state and the properties of the action.
  - Use the reducer function in your application to handle actions and update the state.
