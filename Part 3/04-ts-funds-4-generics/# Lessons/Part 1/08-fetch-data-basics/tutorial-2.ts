// 2. problem appears when we try to iterate over the tours
// tours.map((tour) => {
//   console.log(tour.name)
// })

// 3. to fix, we need to use "any" > but it's NOT GOOD
// when working with TS, we need to provide the shape of the data >> we will do in the next challenge
tours.map((tour: any) => {
  console.log(tour.name)

// return empty array
// throw error in catch block
// we are not setting state values in this function
