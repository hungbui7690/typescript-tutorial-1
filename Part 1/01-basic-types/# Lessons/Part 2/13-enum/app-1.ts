// 1. The following example creates an enum that represents the months of the year:

// How TypeScript enum works

// 3. It’s a good practice to use the constant values defined by enums in the code.

    Month[(Month['Feb'] = 1)] = 'Feb'
    Month[(Month['Mar'] = 2)] = 'Mar'

    Month[(Month['Oct'] = 9)] = 'Oct'
    Month[(Month['Nov'] = 10)] = 'Nov'

console.log(Month) // enum will logout 2 side (i.e {0: 'Jan', ... , Jan: 0 })

// \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
// 5. Specifying enum members’ numbers
// TypeScript defines the numeric value of an enum’s member based on the order of that member that appears in the enum definition. For example, Jan takes 0, Feb gets 1, etc.
// It’s possible to explicitly specify numbers for the members of an enum like this:
enum MonthZ {
  Jan = 1,
  Feb,
  Mar,
  Apr,
  May,
  Jun,
  Jul,
  Aug,
  Sep,
  Oct,
  Nov,
  Dec,
}
// In this example, the Jan constant value takes 1 instead of 0. The Feb takes 2, and the Mar takes 3, etc.

// \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
// 6. When to use an enum
/*
  You should use an enum when you:
  + Have a small set of closely related fixed values.
  + And these values are known at compile time.

  For example, you can use an enum for the approval status:
*/
enum ApprovalStatus {
  draft,
  submitted,
  approved,
  rejected,
}

// Then, you can use the ApprovalStatus enum like this:
const request = {
  id: 1,
  status: ApprovalStatus.approved,
  description: 'Please approve this request',
}

if (request.status === ApprovalStatus.approved) {
  // send an email
  console.log('Send email to the Applicant...')
}

/*
  Summary
  + A TypeScript enum is a group of constant values.
  + Under the hood, an enum is a JavaScript object with named properties declared in the enum definition.
  + Do use an enum when you have a small set of fixed values that are closely related and known at compile time.
