/*
  Tuple
  - A tuple works like an array with some additional considerations:
    + The number of elements in the tuple is fixed.
    + The types of elements are known, and need not be the same.


*/

//1. For example, you can use a tuple to represent a value as a pair of a string and a number:
let skill: [string, number]
skill = ['Programming', 5]

// The order of values in a tuple is important. If you change the order of values of the skill tuple to [5, "Programming"], you’ll get an error:
let skillX: [string, number]
skillX = [5, 'Programming'] // err: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.

// 2. For this reason, it’s a good practice to use tuples with data that are related to each other in a specific order.
// For example, you can use a tuple to define an RGB color that always comes in a three-number pattern: (r,g,b)
let color: [number, number, number] = [255, 0, 0]
// The color[0], color[1], and color[2] would be logically mapped to Red, Green and Blue color values.

// 3. Optional Tuple Elements
// Since TypeScript 3.0, a tuple can have optional elements specified using the question mark (?) postfix.
// For example, you can define an RGBA tuple with the optional alpha channel value:
let bgColor, headerColor: [number, number, number, number?]
bgColor = [0, 255, 255, 0.5]
headerColor = [0, 255, 255]

/*
  Note that the RGBA defines colors using the red, green, blue, and alpha models. The alpha specifies the opacity of the color.

  Summary

      A tuple is an array with a fixed number of elements whose types are known.
