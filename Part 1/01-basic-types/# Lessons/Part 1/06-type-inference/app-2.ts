  Type Inference


*/

// 1. The Best Common Type Algorithm
// a. Consider the following assignment:
let items = [1, 2, 3, null]
// To infer the type of items variable, TypeScript needs to consider the type of each element in the array.
// It uses the best common type algorithm to analyze each candidate type and select the type that is compatible with all other candidates.
// In this case, TypeScript selects the number array type (number | null)[] as the best common type.

// b. If you add a string to the items array, TypeScript will infer the type for the items as an array of numbers and strings: (number | string | null)[]
let itemsX = [0, 1, null, 'Hi']

// c. When TypeScript cannot find the best common type, it returns the union array type. For example:
let arr = [new Date(), new RegExp('d+')]
// In this example, TypeScript infers the type for arr to be (RegExp | Date)[].

// \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
// 2. Contextual typing
// a. TypeScript uses the locations of variables to infer their types. This mechanism is known as contextual typing. For example:
document.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  console.log(event.button)
})
// In this example, TypeScript knows that the event parameter is an instance of MouseEvent because of the click event.

// b. However, when you change the click event to the scroll the event, TypeScript will issue an error:
document.addEventListener('scroll', function (event) {
  console.log(event.button) // compiler error
})
/*
  TypeScript knows that the event in this case, is an instance of UIEvent, not a MouseEvent. And UIEvent does not have the button property, therefore, TypeScript throws an error.

  You will find contextual typing in many cases such as arguments to function calls, type assertions, members of objects and array literals, return statements, and right-hand sides of assignments.

  Type inference vs. Type annotations
  - The following show the difference between type inference and type annotations:

      Type inference	                Type annotations
      TypeScript guesses the type	    You explicitly tell TypeScript the type


  So, when do you use type inference and type annotations?
  - In practice, you should always use the type inference as much as possible. And you use the type annotation in the following cases:
    + When you declare a variable and assign it a value later.
    + When you want a variable that canâ€™t be inferred.
    + When a function returns the any type and you need to clarify the value.


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
  
  Summary
  + Type inference occurs when you initialize variables, set parameter default values, and determine function return types.
  + TypeScript uses the best common type algorithm to select the best candidate types that are compatible with all variables.
  + TypeScript also uses contextual typing to infer types of variables based on the locations of the variables.
