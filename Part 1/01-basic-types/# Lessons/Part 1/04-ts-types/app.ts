  Typescript Types 
  

***********************
  
  What is a type in TypeScript
  - In TypeScript, a type is a convenient way to refer to different properties and functions that a value has.
  - A value is anything you can assign to a variable e.g., a number, a string, an array, an object, and a function.

  - or example, see the following value:
    -> 'Hello'
  - When you look at this value, you can say it is a string. This value has properties and methods that a string has.

  - For example, the 'Hello' value has a property called length that returns the number of characters:
    -> console.log('Hello'.length); // 5

  - It also has many methods like match(), indexOf(), and toLocaleUpperCase(). For example:
    -> console.log('Hello'.toLocaleUpperCase()); // HELLO 

  - When you look at the value 'Hello' and describe it by listing the properties and methods, it would be inconvenient.
  - A shorter way to refer to a value is to assign it a type. In this example, you say 'Hello' is a string. Then, you know that you can use the properties and methods of a string for the value 'Hello'.

  - In conclusion, in TypeScript:
    + a type is a label that describes the different properties and methods that a value has
    + every value has a type.

  Types in TypeScript
  - TypeScript inherits the built-in types from JavaScript. TypeScript types are categorized into:
    + Primitive types
    + Object types

  - Primitive types
      Name	       Description
      string	     Represent text data.
      number	     Represent numeric values.
      boolean	     Have true and false values.
      null	       Have one value: null.
      undefined	   Have one value: undefined. It is the default value of an uninitialized variable.
      symbol	     Represent a unique constant value.

  - Object types
    -> Object types are functions, arrays, classes, etc. Later, you’ll learn how to create custom object types.

  Purposes of types in TypeScript
  - There are two main purposes of types in TypeScript:
    + First, types are used by the TypeScript compiler to analyze your code for errors.
    + Second, types allow you to understand what values are associated with variables.


*/

// The following example uses the querySelector() method to select the <h1> element:
const heading = document.querySelector('h1')
// The TypeScript compiler knows that the type of heading is HTMLHeadingElement
// And it shows a list of methods for the HTMLHeadingElement type that heading can access:
// heading?.

// If you try to access a property or method that doesn’t exist, the TypeScript compiler will show an error. For example:
heading.rotate()

/*
  Summary

    Every value in TypeScript has a type.
    A type is a label that describes the properties and methods that a value has.
    TypeScript compiler uses types to analyze your code for hunting bugs and errors.
