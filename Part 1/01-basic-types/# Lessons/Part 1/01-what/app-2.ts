/*
  Setup 
  - The following tools you need to set up to start with TypeScript:
    + Node.js – Node.js is the environment in which you will run the TypeScript compiler. Note that you don’t need to know node.js.
    + TypeScript compiler – a Node.js module that compiles TypeScript into JavaScript. If you use JavaScript for node.js, you can install the ts-node module. It transforms TypeScript into JavaScript, allowing you to execute TypeScript on Node.js directly without precompiling. 


********************************

  ~~ npm install -g typescript
  ~~ tsc --v
  ~~ tsc --init 


********************************

  - <ts-node> is a TypeScript execution engine and REPL for Node.js.
    + It JIT transforms TypeScript into JavaScript, enabling you to directly execute TypeScript on Node.js without precompiling. 
    + This is accomplished by hooking node's module loading APIs, enabling it to be used seamlessly alongside other Node.js tools and libraries.

  - To install the <ts-node> module globally, you run the following command from the Terminal on macOS and Linux or Command Prompt on Windows:

    ~~ npm install -g ts-node
    
  - Alternative tool to run TS project is <tsx> -> https://tsx.is/
    ~~ npm install -D tsx
    ~~ npx tsx app.js
      -> since we install as dev dependency -> use "npx"
    ~~ npx tsx --watch app.js
