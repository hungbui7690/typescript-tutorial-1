/*
  Getters and Setters


*/

// 1. A getter method starts with the keyword "get" and a setter method begins with the keyword "set".
class PersonX {
  private _age: number
  private _firstName: string
  private _lastName: string

  constructor(age: number, firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this._age = age
    this._firstName = firstName
    this._lastName = lastName
  }

  get age() {
    return this._age
  }

  // add the check at setter
  set age(theAge: number) {
    if (theAge <= 0 || theAge >= 200) {
      throw new Error('The age is invalid')
    }
    this._age = theAge
  }

  getFullName(): string {
    return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`
  }
}
/*
  How it works.
  - First, change the access modifiers of the age, firstName, and lastName properties from public to private.
  - Second, change the property age to _age.
  - Third, create getter and setter methods for the _age property. In the setter method, check the validity of the input age before assigning it to the _age property.


*/

// 2. Now, you can access the age setter method as follows:
let personX = new PersonX(22, 'John', 'Doe')
personX.age = 23

// Notice that the call to the setter doesnâ€™t have parentheses like a regular method. When you call person.age, the age setter method is invoked. If you assign an invalid age value, the setter will throw an error:
personX.age = 0 // Error: The age is invalid

// When you access the person.age, the age getter is invoked.
console.log(personX.age)

// \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
// 3. The following adds the getters and setters to the firstName and lastName properties.
class PersonY {
  private _age: number
  private _firstName: string
  private _lastName: string

  constructor(age: number, firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this._age = age
    this._firstName = firstName
    this._lastName = lastName
  }

  get age() {
    return this._age
  }

  set age(theAge: number) {
    if (theAge <= 0 || theAge >= 200) {
      throw new Error('The age is invalid')
    }
    this._age = theAge
  }

  get firstName() {
    return this._firstName
  }

  set firstName(theFirstName: string) {
    if (!theFirstName) {
      throw new Error('Invalid first name.')
    }
    this._firstName = theFirstName
  }

  get lastName() {
    return this._lastName
  }

  set lastName(theLastName: string) {
    if (!theLastName) {
      throw new Error('Invalid last name.')
    }
    this._lastName = theLastName
  }

  getFullName(): string {
    return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`
  }
}

// 4. More TypeScript Getters/Setters Examples
// As you can see from the code, the setters are useful when you want to validate the data before assigning it to the properties. In addition, you can perform complex logic.

// The following shows how to create the fullname getter and setter.
class PersonZ {
  private _age: number
  private _firstName: string
  private _lastName: string

  constructor(age: number, firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this._age = age
    this._firstName = firstName
    this._lastName = lastName
  }

  get age() {
    return this._age
  }

  set age(theAge: number) {
    if (theAge <= 0 || theAge >= 200) {
      throw new Error('The age is invalid')
    }
    this._age = theAge
  }

  get firstName() {
    return this._firstName
  }

  set firstName(theFirstName: string) {
    if (!theFirstName) {
      throw new Error('Invalid first name.')
    }
    this._firstName = theFirstName
  }

  get lastName() {
    return this._lastName
  }

  set lastName(theLastName: string) {
    if (!theLastName) {
      throw new Error('Invalid last name.')
    }
    this._lastName = theLastName
  }

  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }

  set fullName(name: string) {
    let parts = name.split(' ')
    if (parts.length != 2) {
      throw new Error('Invalid name format: first last')
    }
    this.firstName = parts[0]
    this.lastName = parts[1]
  }
}

/*
  How it works.

    The getter method returns the concatenation of the first name and last name.
    The setter method accepts a string as the full name with the format: first last and assign the first part to the first name property and the second part to the last name property.

*/
// Now, you can access the fullname setter and getter like a regular class property:
let personZ = new PersonZ(22, 'Jane', 'Doe')

personZ.fullName = 'Jane Smith'
console.log(personZ.fullName) // "Jane Smith"

/*
  Summary

    Use TypeScript getters/setters to control the access properties of a class.
    The getter/setters are also known as accessors/mutators.
