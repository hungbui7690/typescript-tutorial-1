/*
  Class
  - JavaScript does not have a concept of class like other programming languages such as Java and C#. In ES5, you can use a constructor function and prototype inheritance to create a “class”.


*/

// 1. For example, to create a Person class that has three properties ssn, first name, and last name, you use the following constructor function:
function Person(ssn, firstName, lastName) {
  this.ssn = ssn
  this.firstName = firstName
  this.lastName = lastName
}

// 2. Next, you can define a prototype method to get the full name of the person by concatenating first name and last name like this:
Person.prototype.getFullName = function () {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
}

// 3. Then, you can use the Person “class” by creating a new object:
let person = new (Person as any)('171-28-0926', 'John', 'Doe')
console.log(person.getFullName())

// \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
// 4. ES6 allows you to define a class, which is simply syntactic sugar for creating constructor functions and prototypal inheritance:
class PersonX {
  ssn
  firstName
  lastName

  constructor(ssn, firstName, lastName) {
    this.ssn = ssn
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }

  getFullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }
}

// Using the Person class is the same as the Person constructor function:
let personX = new PersonX('171-28-0926', 'John', 'Doe')
console.log(personX.getFullName())

// \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
// 5. TypeScript class adds type annotations to the properties and methods of the class. The following shows the Person class in TypeScript:
class PersonZ {
  ssn: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string

  constructor(ssn: string, firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this.ssn = ssn
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }

  getFullName(): string {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }
}

// When you annotate types to properties, constructors, and methods, the TypeScript compiler will carry the corresponding type checks.
// For example, you cannot initialize the ssn with a number. The following code will result in an error:
let personZ = new PersonZ(171280926, 'John', 'Doe')

/*
  Summary

    Use class keyword to define a class in TypeScript.
    TypeScript leverages the ES6 class syntax and adds type annotations to make the class more robust.
