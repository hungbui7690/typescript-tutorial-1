/*
  Access Modifiers
  - private, protected, and public.

  üèê Note that TypeScript controls the access logically during compilation time, not at runtime.


*/

// 1. The public modifier
// The public modifier allows class properties and methods to be accessible from all locations. If you don‚Äôt specify any access modifier for properties and methods, they will take the public modifier by default.
// For example, the getFullName() method of the Person class has the public modifier. The following explicitly adds the public modifier to the getFullName() method:
class Person {
  private ssn: string
  private firstName: string
  private lastName: string

  constructor(ssn: string, firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this.ssn = ssn
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }

  public getFullName(): string {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }
}
// ‚õ≥ It has the same effect as if the public keyword were omitted.

// \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
/*
  2. The protected modifier

  - The protected modifier allows properties and methods of a class to be accessible within the same class and subclasses.
  - When a class (child class) inherits from another class (parent class), it is a subclass of the parent class.

  - The TypeScript compiler will issue an error if you attempt to access the protected properties or methods from anywhere else.
  - To add the protected modifier to a property or a method, you use the protected keyword. For example:

*/
class PersonY {
  protected ssn: string

  // other code
}
// The ssn property now is protected. It will be accessible within the Person class and in any class that inherits from the Person class. You‚Äôll learn more about inheritance here.

// 3. The Person class declares the two private properties and one protected property. Its constructor initializes these properties to three arguments:
class PersonZ {
  protected ssn: string
  private firstName: string
  private lastName: string

  constructor(ssn: string, firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this.ssn = ssn
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }

  getFullName(): string {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }
}

// 4. To make the code shorter, TypeScript allows you to both declare properties and initialize them in the constructor like this:
class PersonX {
  constructor(
    protected ssn: string,
    private firstName: string,
    private lastName: string
  ) {}

  getFullName(): string {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }
}
// When you consider the visibility of properties and methods, it is a good practice to start with the least visible access modifier, which is private.

/*
  Summary
  + TypeScript provides three access modifiers to class properties and methods: private, protected, and public.
    - The private modifier allows access within the same class.
    - The protected modifier allows access within the same class and subclasses.
    - The public modifier allows access from any location.
    - Properties and methods have public access if you omit the access modifiers.
